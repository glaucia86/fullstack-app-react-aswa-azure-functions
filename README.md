## Why another CRUD application?

We noticed that most CRUD application examples only teach how to create the application itself. However, they do not teach how to make the application available in the cloud in a secure, scalable, and cost-effective way.

Therefore, the main goal of this project is to teach how to create a Full Stack application and make it available in the cloud in a secure, scalable, and cost-effective way.
